# üß† Handwritten Digit Recognizer

This is a simple Python-based GUI application that allows users to draw a digit on screen and get it recognized using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the MNIST dataset.


## üì¶ Files in the Repository

- `digit.py` ‚Äì Main application file containing the model training logic and GUI interface using Tkinter.
- `digit_cnn_model.h5` ‚Äì Pretrained CNN model for recognizing digits.
- `requirements.txt` ‚Äì Dependencies needed to run the application.

## üöÄ How It Works

1. **Model Training**
   - If a pretrained model (`digit_cnn_model.h5`) is not found, the script automatically trains a CNN on the MNIST dataset.
   - The model is saved for future use, so training only happens once.

2. **GUI Drawing Interface**
   - A Tkinter canvas lets users draw digits using their mouse.
   - The drawing is resized to 28x28 pixels (MNIST format), preprocessed, and passed to the model.
   - The predicted digit and confidence score are displayed instantly.

## üß† Model Architecture

- 3 Convolutional Layers (LeakyReLU activations)
- Batch Normalization & Dropout for regularization
- MaxPooling for downsampling
- Dense layer before the output
- Softmax output layer for classification into 10 digits (0‚Äì9)
